🎬 Movie Recommendation System
📌 Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python.
It suggests movies to users based on similarity in genres, keywords, cast, and other features.
The project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for recommendation tasks.

🚀 Features

📊 Content-based recommendation

🎭 Uses movie metadata (genres, cast, overview, keywords)

🔍 Cosine similarity for finding similar movies

💻 Easy to run in Jupyter Notebook

🌐 Can be extended into a web app with Streamlit/Flask

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk)

Jupyter Notebook for model building

Cosine Similarity for recommendation logic

📊 How It Works

Load the dataset (movies metadata).

Clean & preprocess text data (genres, cast, keywords).

Convert text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer/TfidfVectorizer.

Compute cosine similarity between movies.

Recommend top N similar movies.

▶️ Usage

Clone the repo and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook firstfile.ipynb

📸 Screenshots (Optional)

Add 1–2 screenshots of your notebook output or recommendation results.
Example:


📌 Future Improvements

✅ Add a Streamlit web app

✅ Deploy on Heroku/Render

✅ Add collaborative filtering for better recommendations
